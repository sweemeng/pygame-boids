# This is my implementation of Boid algorithm. 

Boid algorithm is that simulate flocking behavior in birds. It is also well known that the rule for the behavior is reasonably simple. 

## To run

* I assume that you have poetry running
* Install dependency `poetry install`
* Run by `poetry run python main.py`

## To play

To see flocking behavior, please click on the pygame window
